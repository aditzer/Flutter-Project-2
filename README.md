# Flutter Project


## Weather and Earthquake App


This Project consists of two apps, weather and earthquake app.


Weather App has been made using 'openweather' API, and I have used different packages such as 'flutter_weather_bg_null_safety' for background animations. User can search for different cities to know their weather.


Earthquake app has been made using 'Google Map' API and 'Earthquake Usgs' API.
